# Weather App #
Simple and basic weather app.
This app is a way I can keep up-to-date to the technology as it evolves.
I started it 10 years ago as a General Assembly class project and it's become my experimental sandbox.

I've written it in vanilla JS (spaghetti code) with Bower and Grunt as build tools, later on I converted it into a modular code approach using jQuery and finally with the help of Jules by Google I was able to rewrite the entire app in React and TypeScript using the latests tools there are out there.
